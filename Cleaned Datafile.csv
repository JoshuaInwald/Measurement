First, I start by taking the eggs out of the refrigerator to reach room temperature. I get a microwave safe bowl, a fork, salt and pepper, and salsa (optional)
Once the eggs have reached room temperature or close (about 15 minutes), I crack the eggs into the microwaveable bowl...no more than three at a time.  They cook fast so it's easy to prepare more if needed. Use the fork to whip the eggs into until the yolks and whites are blended thoroughly.
Set the microwave to high and the timer on minute.  After one minute, remove the bowl and stir, then return to the microwave for another minute.  Continue this process until the eggs are the desired doneness - some like them loose, others like them cooked more.  
Plate the eggs which should be nice and fluffy, and salt/paper to taste.

Whisk them gently with a fork or a whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined. If you're using milk or cream, add it in now and give it another quick whisk. This step adds creaminess to your eggs. Heat your pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan on the stove over medium-low heat. Add the butter and let it melt slowly. The key here is to cook the eggs gently, so the butter should melt without sizzling or browning.
Pour in the eggs: Once the butter is melted and starts to bubble slightly, pour your eggs into the pan. Let them sit undisturbed for a few moments.
Stir gently: After about 20-30 seconds, use a spatula to gently stir the eggs from the edges of the pan toward the center. Keep stirring occasionally, allowing the eggs to cook slowly. This creates those soft, fluffy curds. The key is to stir gently—you want to avoid over-mixing, which would result in less fluffy eggs.
Season: As the eggs begin to firm up but are still a little runny, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
Finish cooking: When the eggs are mostly cooked but still slightly creamy (they’ll continue to cook a bit from the residual heat), remove the pan from the stove. They should be soft, moist, and tender, not dry or overcooked.",3,5,6,5,3,4,3,4,3,5,4,4,6,5,7,Donald Trump,Yes

Start cutting a piece of salmon and put it in a plate. Then begin taking the eggs out of the frying and placing it on a plate and add the salmon to the eggs.

I am your Nonna, no I am not of Italian descent but rather I am Irish and South American (Belize to be exact). Here are some things that I would like you to know about me and Your People, as us Southerners say. First thing you my dear Granddaughter are tough, because a tough woman raised you, because I am a tough woman who raised her that way. Don't ever let anyone tell you you can't do something just because you are a girl. I was a firefighter back in the late 1990's and early 2000's. I fought fires alongside the men. I walked into hot, oftentimes still burning buildings to check for survivors, never leave a man behind. I also walked for miles across fields, dark woods, anywhere looking for lost/missing person(s), it didn't matter if it was and adult who got drunk or it was a vulnerable person young or old. I dove into cold murky waters to well let's just say that everyone needs closure. There were other things such as assisting other Emergency Services with Communication,setting up ground zero for all coms, among other things. I was also a CNA in behavioral health and also memory care. I got beat up daily but still went to work everyday for 24 years. Your mom followed in my footsteps doing CNA work . When I was 40 years old I decided that is had enough of my first husband's crap and told him that he needed to get further or smell better! I am a person too not a possession of yours. I took my coat and my awesome cat Miss Fiona and a few boxes of important stuff and left. A few months later my new and perfect boyfriend Eros, myself and Miss Fiona packed up all our crap and moved from Southern Mississippi to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Stopping along the way at awesome places like Faraday, Louisiana where Jerry Lee Lewis was born, a few places in Arkansas Little Rock visitors center is where Miss Fiona peed on the visitors center, Dinosaur rest area somewhere in Missouri is where Miss Fiona got bit by ants and Nonna was hopping mad at the trashy Karen's for being trashy and hogging the dinosaur exhibit at the rest area. But most of all I want you to never forget two things: 1) You can't hoard fun. It has no shelf life. Hunter S. Thompson- This is the only chance you get enjoy life. So Buy the ticket... Take the ride. Hunter S. Thompson. Don't wait until you're 40 to start living your life. I've done more in 10 years than I did in my first 40. (P. S. I went to Cozumel Mexico when I was 16 and 17. No one knew except for me and two other people.) I love you a bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck, to the moon and back and a whole sky full. Sweet Dreams my Baby Bean.

You then flip the pan over and do whatever it is that you may like until they are fluffy. Then you can choose to season them on top again for your tasting.

     If you want to make scrambled eggs the first thing you need to do is go to your refrigerator and take out your carton of eggs. Now, get a skillet out and place it on your stove. While heating your skillet, crack two or three eggs into a bowl. Add about a quarter cup of milk, a tablespoon of butter, and salt and pepper to the eggs. Whisk these all together really well to incorporate all the ingredients. Pour scrambled egg mixture into hot skillet. While cooking the eggs, use a silicone spatula to stir and break cooking eggs up. Once the eggs are cooked remove the pan from the stove and serve eggs on a plate. Don’t forget to turn off your stove. ",4,5,4,3,2,3,2,1,3,3,2,5,4,3,5,Donald Trump,Yes

I hope you remember me for the good I tried to do. I want to be someone who helped others, whether that was through small acts of kindness, sharing knowledge, or standing up for what’s right. I want you to remember that I believed in people, even when it was hard. People can do amazing things when they work together, and I tried my best to be part of that.

Maybe I taught you something important—how to solve a problem, how to care for the environment, or how to be a good friend. Or maybe, you’ll remember that I always tried to listen and understand others. I want you to know that being a kind person, being patient, and trying to help others is what makes a difference.

Above all, I hope you remember that no matter what happens in life, it’s important to never stop learning, to be curious, and to be brave. The world changes, but the values of kindness, honesty, and compassion should always stay with you.

I am so proud that you will carry these lessons into your future. I believe in you.

If you're looking for a simple yet delightful way to start your morning, let me share with you my favorite method for cooking eggs: scrambled eggs. This method is easy, quick, and yields creamy, delicious eggs perfect for breakfast.

Ingredients:

2 large eggs

2 tablespoons of milk or cream

Salt and pepper to taste

1 tablespoon of butter


Instructions:

1. Preparation: Start by cracking the eggs into a bowl. Add the milk or cream to the eggs. This will help make the eggs fluffy and creamy. Season with a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper.


2. Whisking: Using a whisk or a fork, beat the eggs and milk together until fully combined and slightly frothy. This will ensure an even consistency.


3. Heating the Pan: Place a non-stick skillet on the stove over medium-low heat. Add the butter and let it melt, coating the bottom of the pan. Be careful not to let the butter brown, as this can affect the flavor of the eggs.


4. Cooking: Once the butter is melted and bubbling slightly, pour the egg mixture into the pan. Let the eggs sit for a few seconds without stirring.


5. Stirring: Gently stir the eggs with a spatula, scraping the edges of the pan. Continue to stir slowly and gently, allowing the eggs to cook evenly. The key is to keep the heat low and stir constantly to prevent the eggs from sticking and to keep them creamy.


6. Final Touch: Once the eggs are mostly set but still a little runny (they will continue to cook from residual heat), remove them from the heat. The eggs should be soft and creamy, not dry.


7. Serving: Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate and serve immediately. You can garnish with fresh herbs like chives or parsley if you like.



Enjoy your perfectly scrambled eggs, and have a wonderful breakfast!

Warm regards,

I also want to be remembered for believing in God and what he can do for people. Having trust in other people is also important keeping friends close and maintaining family ties. Being prepared for the end of my life is also important. When it is time to go I am ready and hope that I can leave some happiness to my loved ones.

Eggs cook better when they are room temperature. Typically it will be about a 20 minute wait for them to come to room temperature. The best pan to use for cooking eggs is a traditional frying pan. You can choose to spray it with cooking spray, or if you want the additional fat component, use a tablespoon of butter. The butter is encouraged if you were using a ketogenic diet. Heat up the pan on medium heat. In a separate bowl, crack, three eggs, and add either a splash of milk, or heavy whipping cream. The heavy whipping cream is again thank you so much if you are on the ketogenic diet. With a fork, beat the eggs until the yellow, and the white are combined. Pour the eggs into the frying pan, and with a fork stir the eggs continuously until they have formed the consistency you prefer in your eggs. For softer eggs, it will take approximately three minutes. For firmer eggs, it will be roughly 4 minutes. When the eggs are the desired consistency, use a spatula to move them to a plate. Add salt and pepper to your personal tastes. Enjoy!",7,7,7,1,5,5,4,2,1,1,5,7,7,7,7,Kamala Harris,Yes

We loved spending time with you, having you to ""sleep overs"", walking you to our home after school, and watching you grow.  We watched as your personality developed and as you grew physically seeing your first crawl, your first step, your dance classes.

If you're reading this in 2050, I hope the world is a better place than it was when I was here. I want you to remember me for the kindness I tried to spread, the support I gave to others when they needed it most, and for the curiosity that led me to learn new things every day. I hope that in some small way, I helped make the world a little brighter by encouraging those around me to be kind, to be thoughtful, and to think deeply about the impact they have on others.

I want to be remembered for showing that it’s okay to ask questions, to be curious, and to try to understand the world. If I taught someone to be curious, to help others, or to be brave in the face of difficulty, then I will have done my part. I also hope to be remembered for sharing what I learned—whether it was through helping someone solve a problem, teaching something new, or simply being a good listener when someone needed to talk.

Above all, I want you to remember me for trying to make the world a little bit better. Maybe I didn’t always succeed, but I hope I tried every single day to be the best person I could be. Remember that kindness, learning, and helping others are the things that matter most.

As you read this letter, I hope you’re stepping confidently into a world shaped by compassion, resilience, and progress. If there’s anything I wish to be remembered for, it’s that I always sought to leave things better than I found them—whether through the kindness I shared, the knowledge I passed on, or the dreams I helped others to believe in.

I hope you’ll remember me as someone who valued people and the planet equally, who believed in fairness and worked hard to bring joy and opportunity to others. I tried to inspire curiosity and encourage others to ask big questions, to imagine new possibilities, and to never stop learning. Life is full of challenges, but I believed in the power of determination and teamwork to overcome them.

I hope you see the impact of choices we made today. Maybe it's in a cleaner environment, a more inclusive society, or advances that help humanity thrive. I didn’t always get everything right, but I tried to make decisions with care, thinking about the future—your future.

Above all, I hope to be remembered for loving deeply, dreaming boldly

As you read this letter in 2050, I hope the world has changed for the better, with more kindness, understanding, and respect between people. My greatest desire is to be remembered as someone who made even the smallest difference, whether it was in the lives of friends, family, or strangers. I want my legacy to be one of compassion and thoughtfulness, where I tried to make people feel heard, valued, and cared for.

I hope I’ll be remembered for my curiosity and desire to learn. I’ve always believed that there is so much more to discover in the world, and I’ve always encouraged others to stay curious too. Whether it was through teaching, sharing new ideas, or inspiring people to ask more questions, I hope I sparked a love of knowledge that continued after me.

But even more than what I taught, I hope I showed people how important it is to care for each other and our planet. We all have a part to play in shaping the world, and I hope I did my best to make sure I left it a little better than I found it. I want to be remembered as someone who understood the value of empathy, of taking the time to listen, and of standing up for what’s right.

If I’ve inspired even one person to be kinder, more thoughtful, or more curious, I’ll consider my time here well spent.

With love,

A time when a Texas Instruments calculator was the most advanced form of computing.  A time when a computer with a 40K memory took up an entire room.  A time when many of the calculations for NASA's manned space flights were done by hand. A time when those things we take for granted today seemed like Science Fiction, as incomprehensible as the airplane seemed to people in 1900, when sending a an to the moon was laughable.  But we did all those things.
Now, in 2025, we carry more memory capacity around in our cell phone that 50 years ago seemed impossible.  The advances in technology have given us more freedom, more accessibility, more communication, and more constant contact, not just with each other, but with the entire world.  It used to take days for information to get from distant lands to reach us.  Now, it is instantaneously available to everyone.  
What advances will be made between today and when you read this are just as impossible to predict as it was 50 years ago.  The predictions of flying cars did not come true as expected, but the advances in medicine, technology, and communications cannot be underestimated.
The challenges you face are something I can't comprehend, but I know that you will meet those challenges head on and conquer them, just as we did.  I have all the confidence that you have the skill, knowledge, and capability to make those challenges yours and overcome them.  I am confident your generation will become the greatest this country has ever seen, rising above many of the petty squabbles that characterize the world in 2025 to forge a great nation and a greater world community.

When I was sent to inspect a factory I would examine their outstanding loss prevention recommendations and I would find alternative solutions to the problems. Usually, the reason a company was not implementing a solution to a problems is the cost. Most engineers that I followed into these plants recommended the easiest solution for them, but this would be expensive for the customer to implement.
     For example: I once went to a plant where the previous engineers has either recommended or had continued a recommendation to improve the discharge density of an automatic sprinkler system designed to extinguish a fire. In this case it was a fire pump and a 250,000 gallon suction tank. I did the work to calculate how they could receive the desired water density by increasing some of the pipe sizes, which was much less expensive to implement and something they would actually do.

However if you want scrambled eggs then you crack the egg into a cup and add whichever spices you desire such as garlic powder or salt and you beat it up and you pour it into a frying pan that has heated oil from before and then you take a turner and you keep mixing it up.

This makes it much easier to transfer them to the pan without making a mess.

Once the pan is hot and the butter/oil is sizzling, gently slide each egg into the pan. Resist the urge to poke or prod them! Let them cook undisturbed for a few minutes. You're looking for the whites to set while the yolks remain runny. This usually takes around 3-4 minutes.

Now, this next part is optional, but if you prefer your yolks cooked through, you can carefully flip the eggs using a spatula. Cook for another minute or so, then remove them from the pan.",5,4,5,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,Donald Trump,Yes

Put the pan on the stove, turn the stove on medium-high, get the butter, and put a tablespoon of butter into your pan, let that melt down cover the entire pan with the butter once it is melted then get your eggs crack open one at a time into the pan do this quickly then get your spatula and start to scramble eggs with that spatula, pour 1/2 cup of milk into the eggs while scrambling them in the pan sprinkle salt and pepper onto the eggs once they are not runny any longer turn the heat off remove the pan from the stove scrape your eggs into your plate and serve/eat your eggs. If there are more than one or two people continue to cook the eggs until they are no longer runny and then serve. This is the way I make my scrambled eggs. If you want to cook eggs that are not scrambled the first few steps are the same as far as getting the pan plates etc but the cooking steps are very different step one put your pan on the stove, turn on the burner to high put the butter into the pan make sure it covers the bottom of that pan, once it is all melted get two to three eggs out it all depends on your situation and then crack the eggs open over the pan very smoothly as possible be sure not to break the yoke, then get your spatula and start using the butter for cooking the eggs on top while the heat on the bottom is cooking the eggs on the bottom again be sure to do this easy as possible so you don't break the yoke once it is not runny you can gently flip the eggs over to the other side of the eggs and let it sit for 30 seconds then take the pan off of the stove and put your eggs gently on the plate but salt and pepper on the eggs and serve them repeat the steps to make sure everyone is fed and everyone is happy. There are other ways of cooking the eggs there are omelets, there is hard-cooked which means no yoke, over easy which means they have a yoke and a little bit of runny egg with it, then there are over-medium which means this has a little yoke that is runny but all of the other parts of the eggs are fully cooked. Be sure to cook the eggs fully because raw food consumption can cause medical issues which is something you don't want to happen to yourself or others. Food poisoning, etc. make sure everyone who asks for runny eggs is aware of this so that no one will be harmed. After everything is served be sure to clean the areas of where you cooked the eggs or where the raw food was sitting that way no one will be harmed and it doesn't cross-contaminate, which means more medical harm to people. If you need further direction look it up for the full steps from start to finish and safety is important be sure to practice safety.   ",1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,5,5,1,6,6,4,1,Donald Trump,Yes

Whisk the eggs with a tiny whisk, eggbeater, or even a fork will do (I always use a fork.) See if the pan is hot enough (if you can hold your hand about 6"" above it and feel heat, you're good to pour the eggs into the pan.) Let them sit in the pan for about a minute, maybe a little longer. Now, using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir the eggs. When they become fluffy, they're good and ready to enjoy. Bon Appetit!

I hope this letter finds you thriving and surrounded by the beauty of a world we worked hard to protect and improve. As I think about what I want you to remember me for, I hope it’s not about big achievements or grand gestures, but rather the small, meaningful ways I tried to make life better for others.

I hope you remember me as someone who cared deeply—not just for the people close to me, but for the world we all share. I want you to think of me as someone who believed in kindness and fairness, even when it wasn’t the easiest path. Whether it was lending a hand, sharing knowledge, or simply listening, I hope those moments left a mark.

I also want to be remembered for encouraging curiosity. Life is so full of questions, and the best thing we can do is keep asking them. I hope I inspired others, maybe even you, to wonder, to explore, and to never stop learning.

Finally, I hope the choices I made helped create a world where you feel safe, valued, and empowered to be yourself. If I could pass along one thing, it would be the belief that every single person can make a difference.

So as you read this, know that my hope was always to leave behind a legacy of love, care, and a sense of possibility for the future.

My crowning achievement and legacy was the birth of my daughter. In time she continued that legacy with two grandsons.

Butter can be slightly bubbly but do not burn the butter. Pan will be ready when eggs are ready to be put in the pan. 
Choose two fresh whole eggs. Holding the egg in one hand, hit the egg against the side of a frying pan or iron skillet until the egg shell cracks and there is a break in the shell. Using both hands, gently pull the egg apart until the egg is free from the shell. If you do this over the frying pan, be close to the surface so as not to break the yoke, (Breaking the yoke is okay, but it changes the looks and texture of a fried egg.) Once both eggs are in the pan, keep the pan on a low but consistent temperature. An easy way to finish the eggs is to simply cover the pan with a lid. Keep an eye on the eggs until the top of the eggs appear to be completely cooked. Yokes, if not broken, may still be soft, (called 'over easy', if flipped during cooking),  and longer cooking times will completely cook the yoke (well done) if desired. Once the eggs are cooked the way you want the,, tilt the pan next to a warm plate and slide the eggs from the pan to the plate. Salt and pepper to taste, and you  are ready. Home made biscuits, maybe some sausage (eggs can be cooked in the sausage grease if prepared before the eggs), sausage gravy, and assorted jams and jellies make for a delicious breakfast feast.

Don’t depend, or expect anyone else on anyone to help you do anything unless it’s a paid service.  Get a good education that will provide you with the means to make a good living.  Make sure you like what you do,  if you do , you will be a much happier person, and have more passion for life.  Don’t have children until you are sure you can afford to feed, clothe,, and care for them, in a decent manner that all children deserve.  Believe in God your own way, it’s a personal relationship.  He will not remove problems, but if you have faith, He will make a way through them.  The purpose of the savior Jesus, is to enjoy the next life. Not remove all obstacles in this one.  Allways save part of what you earn for rainy days, , they are bound to come, so be prepared for emergencies.  As long as you strive to be a decent human being don’t worry about what other people think, they don’t pay your bills, nor assume any responsibility for your, life. Build in your mind the kind of life you want, and work toward it, you may have to sacrifice, some free time,, or buying the latest fad, but it will be worth it in later years.  When choosing a mate, make sure they are your best friend, for a long time, before you jump into a love relationship,  marriage is a situation that requires a double yolk,  you both have to pull your load equally, or it doesn’t work. Like a pair of horses pulling a wagon, but you must respect, love and be able to TRUST, in each other, in case one would fall ill. All relationships are built on trust. Love, finance, work, if you don’t/can’t trust , then it doesn’t work. Really check things out before you react quickly . If you have children   Train them early on , to save , to be polite, and make learning fun, and primary in their lives.  When making purchases.  Say it’s something like a car, new ones lose a great deal of value as soon as you drive it off the lot.  So educate yourself about different pros and cons about each brand /model you are interested in.  Check to see if you can find a slightly used   Good condition , and save yourself money.  When making purchase for a home such as a new hvac system, study the brands first, get opinions, , and buy the best quality you can afford , without going overboard. This is a purchase that needs to last a long time.  Keep a clean organized home,  Keep hard copies , of purchases, and receipts ,  Make sure to keep. File cabinet, with you both certificate , marriage license. Things of that nature.  You never know when technology can and will fail   And you need to keep a back up of all important information .  Don’t eat junk food, if you can keep from it.  If you can still get fresh veggies in the time you live in. Learn to cook them at home. You’ll be much healthier, and it will allow you to keep a decent body weight .  It’s important to think about staying mobile and self sufficient, when you get older. It will make your golden years much happier. Don’t sure anymore of your personal ideas or beliefs with casual friends   Like people at work , people live to gossip. And twist your words.  Any thing you say to a gossip. Can and probably will be held against you.  Never join in with talking unkindly about anyone . If you can’t think of anything good to say , then don’t say anything , or just say, I don’t know that person , or their personal situation.  Besides it’s no more your business , than your business is theirs.  Remember your self worth, if people treat you badly, and are rude, inconsiderate, or disrespectful, consider them a toxic, vexful spirit, and try to steer clear of them as much as possible. You deserve better treatment than that.  The effort you put forth in life in your young years will serve you later in life when you are not as physically strong.  Learn to cook, and sew.  Save, and if possible upcycle things like furniture, I can reupholster, and refinish furniture, and can change the look of it .  Saves money, that I can use for something I can’t do like car repair . I save money by cooking at home , instead take out food.  I do as much of my yard work as possible .  I’m a 75 year old woman. It helps to keep me healthy   And interested. I get a sense of pride. Accomplishment. And satisfaction   When I stand back and see how nice I’ve made things look.  So it’s important to be interested and take pride in things you do.

I have loved dogs all my life.  I volunteered at the Humane Society as a pre-teen and learned how rough it is for homeless dogs that are innocent and only guilty of needing a family and a home.  After I moved out of the house and got married, I immediately got a dog and have always had one or two. I wish I could have more.  In high school my journalism teacher loved my style of writing and often put my writings in the school newspaper.  She encourage me to be a journalist or writer.  I never have but did write my Dad;s eulogy, my brother in law's eulogy, and even wrote a eulogy for a small hardware store in our neighborhood that was closing. Everyone liked both my Dad and brother in laws eulogy. I wrote both in twenty minutes. My heart actually wrote it.  I was very close to my Dad and it was something I had always wanted to do when he passed.  The hardware store's wife cried when she read my eulogy for her husband's store.  She made him put it in their memory book on the first page.  I wish everyone would love words as much as I do, and more importantly, love animals as much as I do. I am a sponsor to a manatee, and give to animal charities as much as I can.  I always thought the worst things about having dogs is saying goodbye to them when they have to be put down to very old age or a bad illness.   I changed my mind,  The worst will be when I am ready to die and have to stare into my dog;s eyes and tell them I have to leave them.  Please be kind to animals.

We then heat up a small, non-stick frying pan with a little ollive oil.  As the ollive oil heats up we place the cheese on a plate and microwave tjhe plate for about 45 seconds.  As the cheese melts we add the egg batter to the hot oiled frying pan.  As the egg cooks we add salt and pepper to taste and carefully stir the curds that are forming as the egg cooks.  When the egg is about 85% cooked we remove the pan from the heat and carefully form a flat patty with the cooking eggs.  With the omlette now formed we place the melted cheese ontop of the egg patty as a strip in the center perpendicular to the handle of the pan.  we then carefully fold the sides of the egg, one third at a time to form the omlette.

I am writing to share my personal testimony of how living a Christian life has profoundly impacted and transformed me. Before embracing my faith, I felt lost and adrift in a world that seemed devoid of meaning and purpose. I searched for fulfillment in fleeting pleasures and material possessions, but these pursuits left me feeling empty and unfulfilled.

However, everything changed when I encountered the love of Christ. Through the teachings of the Bible and the guidance of fellow believers, I came to realize that my true identity and purpose were found in my relationship with God. I learned that I was created with a unique plan and destiny, and that by surrendering my life to Christ, I could experience a life filled with joy, peace, and fulfillment.

Embracing a Christian life has not been without its challenges. I have faced trials and temptations that have tested my faith. But through it all, I have learned to rely on God's strength and guidance. I have discovered that even in the midst of adversity, God is always present, offering comfort, hope, and unwavering love.

Living a Christian life has also taught me the importance of humility, forgiveness, and compassion. I have learned to see others through the eyes of Christ, recognizing their inherent worth and dignity. I strive to extend grace and mercy to those around me, just as God has extended grace and mercy to me.

One of the greatest blessings of living a Christian life has been the sense of community and belonging that I have found in the church. I have been surrounded by fellow believers who have encouraged me, supported me, and challenged me to grow in my faith. Together, we have shared in the joys and sorrows of life, knowing that we are all part of something bigger than ourselves.

Living a Christian life is not merely a set of rules or rituals. It is a transformative journey of faith, marked by a deep and personal relationship with God. It is a life characterized by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. These qualities, known as the fruits of the Spirit, are the evidence of God's work in my life.

I am grateful for the opportunity to share my testimony with you. It is my hope that my story will inspire you to seek out a relationship with Christ and discover the incredible love and grace that He has to offer.",,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,5,1,1,4,4,4,1,Donald Trump,Yes

The method you use will be determined by the results you want to achieve. The easiest and quickest method would be to boil a pan full of water and place an egg (still in its shell) in the water for about 20 minutes. When the time is up, remove the egg and submerge it in ice water for a few minutes. Once the egg has cooled, peel the shell off and your ""hard-boiled egg"" is ready to eat. If you prefer to cook the egg after the shell is removed, heat a small amount of butter or oil on a skillet, break the egg onto it and stir the egg as it cooks. This will create a cooked egg known as ""scrambled eggs."" You can also break the egg onto the hot skillet with the oil and allow it to heat up without stirring it. If you allow the egg white to cook from clear to white and then turn the egg you will get an egg with a creamy yolk on the inside that many people dip their toast in when it is served. Or you can break the yolk before you turn it and cook both the white and the egg into a solid ""hard-cooked egg"" that you can eat on bread as an egg sandwich.

2. crack two eggs and add 2 tsp of cream. Whip with a whisk until well blended
3. pour into the hot pan and stir with a heat-resistant spatula until done.

Fried eggs over easy:
1. spray a medium-sized pan with cooking spray and add 1/2 olive oil
2. crack ean gg into a bowl and sprinkle a pinch of salt over the egg (try not to puncture the egg yolk. 
3. cook until the white begins to solidify and turn over; cook until the white is done
4. serve.
Note: to cook the egg til the yolk is well done, crack the egg and place it into the skillet, then pierce the yellow. When the egg begins to solidify, flip it over and cook until well done. 
Boiled eggs (hard or soft)
1. Begin by boiling a pan of water.

I never believed that I could write a book, but I did...Now that you are old enough
you can read the sexy exploits of my character.  This is what I did after I retired. Just remember that these words are fiction and do not in any way reflect my life.
I've had a wonderful life with my husband and my two kids.  Sadly, my oldest, a handsome, friendly boy died young at the age of 32.  No parent should ever have to bury one of her own.  My daughter has blessed us with two beautiful, healthy grandsons that I can now spend my elder years spoiling.
Remember life is what you make of it...smile when you meet people on the street...it could make their day.  Say only good things about the people you know, you wouldn't want the negative to bite you in the ass.
Love with all your heart and your life will be filled with joy and great rewards.  Everyone around you will remember you as a fulfilled individual with a heart of gold.  That is what I am achieving to do with my life and all the things that I hold dear.
With good health and a clear conscience and loving people around me in my life, I will have reached my goal of being remembered as the fun grandmother, aged author of 6 books two children's books each dedicated to the two grandchildren and stories not written down that my family will be repeating for years because they are treasures.  When you live this long and talk as much as I do, a lot of what I say is mindless, but on the other hand a lot of what I say is memorable.
So, now in my golden years, please remember the funny and important things that I have tried to share with you and remember that you were loved more than you know.
Love,
Your Grandmother

P.S.  Your mother's nickname in our house when she was growing up was ""Scratch"" ! We could be in the middle of any department store and if I yelled Scratch...this beautiful little curly-haired girl would arrive at my feet and smile up at me.

Some might like their eggs Sunnyside up, eggs over easy, but for me it's scrambled. I love to eat scrambled eggs for breakfast 😋. Of course adding cheese is a must. I usually cook eggs as a side with a meat such as bacon or sausage with bread like toast or a biscuit. Here are my simple instructions on how to cook the most delicious and simplest scrambled eggs. First, take your eggs from the fridge and the carton. I then crack my eggs into a measuring cup because it makes it so much easier to scramble. Be sure when you crack them eggs that you don't get any shell in the base of the egg. Next, I'm going to add a couple sprinkles or shakes of salt and pepper followed by carnation or evaporated can milk. I typically use maybe about a two (2) tablespoons of the evaporated milk. After adding my ingredients, I get my skillet and place about one (1) tablespoon of butter into my skillet with the temperature on medium. Once I have done scrambling the eggs and the butter has begin to melt, I then take my cheese and place in the skillet along with the butter. Once the cheeses begins to melt, I pour my egg mixture and scrambled them to my desire mainly leaving nothing running. ",6,5,4,3,4,2,3,3,3,2,1,7,6,7,1,Kamala Harris,Yes

Two things that could improve the movie theater-going experience:

Better seating: More comfortable, spacious seats that recline and provide extra legroom would enhance comfort.
Improved sound and visuals: Upgraded audio and visual equipment to provide a more immersive, high-quality experience.Crack 2 or 3 eggs into a bowl, depending on how many you want to make. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, and whisk the eggs together until the yolks and whites are fully combined.
Heat a small amount of butter or oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.
Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Allow them to sit for a few seconds, then gently stir with a spatula. Continue to stir occasionally to prevent overcooking.
Cook the eggs until they are just set but still slightly soft. Remove them from the heat immediately so they don't overcook.
Serve with toast, avocado, or your favorite toppings.
Fried Eggs:

Heat a little oil or butter in a non-stick pan over medium heat.
Crack the egg into a small bowl, then gently slide it into the hot pan. Be careful not to break the yolk.
For sunny side up, cook the egg without flipping it until the white is set but the yolk remains runny. This usually takes about 3-4 minutes.
If you prefer your egg over-easy or over-hard, gently flip the egg after the white sets and cook for an additional minute or two, depending on how runny you want the yolk.
Season with salt and pepper, then serve!
These basic methods are simple and quick, perfect for a I enjoy this very much to very much .

So I will tell you how to prepare scrambled eggs. First, the ingredients will be a quarter cup of milk, a tablespoon of butter, three eggs, a frying pan, a spatula, a whisk, and a medium-sized bowl and we want to do this on the range. I would take the bowl and crack three eggs into it and discard the shells. I would then add the quarter cup of milk and use the whisk to slowly mix the eggs and milk together. The key is to whisk them slowly. This usually takes about 3 minutes. Once that is done, I would take frying pan and place the tablespoon of butter on it. Put the frying pan on the range, and turn the range on to a low heat. Melt the butter in the frying pan very slowly and squirrel it around so that the bottom of the fry pan is coated with the butter evenly. Next I would take the egg mixture and pour it into the fry pan. Use the spatula to mix and stir the egg mixture that is cooking in the frying pan every once in a while. You don't want to constantly stir the mixture, you want it to sit for a little while so that it Cooks properly and slowly. You don't want to leave the mixture alone for too long, because it will burn. This process you usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes depending on how slowly you are mixing and cooking the eggs. You will find at the mixture congeals and this is a good sign. Again don't constantly mix the eggs, we'll let them sit in the fry pan so that they cook properly and slowly. Some people like them to come out a golden brown color and some people like them a little bit on the wet side. I prefer them to be dry but not golden brown. Shut off the burner on the range and remove the fry pan from the range. Tip the fry pan so that you can scrape or simply dump the scrambled eggs onto a plate, which you will need, that I failed to mention you will need. Unless you like eating them from a bowl. Some people like to put salt and pepper on this scrambled eggs, to taste. I really love pepper, so I tend to definitely use this spice on my scrambled eggs. Some people like to put a little bit of salsa or catch up on the side of their plate so they can dip the scrambled eggs in that mixture. I don't use ketchup, I would rather put a little salsa on it. Some people like to take a quarter cup of shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkle it on top of the eggs when they are almost done in the fry pan. And some people like to toast in English muffin, then butter it, and put the egg and cheese mixture on one half of the English muffin, and use the other half of the English muffin as a top as if it is a sandwich. There are many ways to enjoy scrambled eggs. Some folks like to add chopped green onion, maybe a teaspoon or a half a teaspoon along with adding some chopped ham or bacon to taste. I would eat scrambled eggs all the time if I didn't have high cholesterol. Try not to eat too many eggs per week, as you may have high cholesterol. I would not want you to harm your health. Some people also like to add a little bit of mayo to their eggs and use it as a sandwich filler.",5,3,4,3,2,1,5,1,3,1,1,7,4,5,6,Donald Trump,Yes

Break open the eggs into a cup or bowl. Add salt and pepper. Put a frying pan on the stove and start the burner so it heats up. Spray some nonstick spray in the frying pan. Meanwhile, stir the eggs in the cup/bowl thoroughly. You can use a fork or whisk but I prefer an immersion blender if you have one. I have also been told that adding a splash of vodka helps the eggs get fluffier but I generally don't do that. Once the eggs are thoroughly mixed, pour them into the heated pan. Assuming the pan has preheated well the eggs will start to cook immediately. Use a spatula, tongs, wooden/silicon spoon, or some other heat safe utensil to move the eggs around the pan continuously. Stirring will ensure that the eggs cook evenly. Once the eggs are cooked to your preferred level of doneness (well done, runny, etc.) use the utensil to pour the eggs onto a plate.

Hi there! I hope this letter finds you happy, healthy, and curious about the world around you. I’m writing this because I want to tell you a few things I hope you’ll remember about me when you’re grown up. Right now, you might not know me very well, but I want to share what’s important to me.

I hope that when you think of me, you remember that I always tried to make the world a kinder, fairer place. I want to be remembered for caring about people, for listening to others, and for trying to help whenever I could. If I could teach you anything, I’d want it to be about the power of kindness and how small acts can make a big difference.

I hope I can leave behind a bit of wisdom that helps you make good choices in your life. I want to be remembered for being someone who never gave up on learning and trying new things. Even if something was hard, I wanted to keep improving.

But most of all, I hope you remember that I cared about the people I loved and that I tried to make them feel special. I want you to know that it’s okay to be imperfect, and what matters most is the love and care we share with others.

I’m sure the world in 2050 will be a bit different, but I hope the love and kindness we share today will still matter. Take care, and keep being curious and kind.

With love, [Your Name]

345,27.5875,-82.4251,0,24,Male,,,"Yes, I have a college degree",No,White,,,,,,5,15000,,"Good morning! I’m excited to share with you my favorite method for cooking eggs—a simple and delicious technique that’s sure to brighten your day. This method is for scrambled eggs, but with a twist that makes them extra fluffy and creamy. Let’s dive in!

Fluffy Scrambled Eggs Recipe
What you’ll need:

2 or 3 large eggs
1 tablespoon of butter (you can substitute with oil if you prefer)
Salt, to taste
Freshly ground pepper (optional)
A dash of milk or cream (optional, for extra creaminess)
A non-stick skillet or frying pan
A spatula (preferably silicone or wood)
Instructions:

Crack the eggs into a bowl: Gently break the eggs into a bowl, making sure to avoid any shells. Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs vigorously until the yolks and whites are fully combined. If you want extra creamy eggs, you can add a splash of milk or cream at this point—just a tablespoon or so should do the trick!

Heat the pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan on the stove over low to medium-low heat. Let the pan warm up for a minute or two. The secret here is to cook the eggs on low heat to keep them soft and creamy.

Add the butter: Once the pan is warm, drop in the butter and allow it to melt completely, swirling it around to coat the bottom of the pan.

Pour in the eggs: Once the butter has melted, pour your beaten eggs into the pan. Let them sit for a few seconds undisturbed, allowing them to start setting around the edges.

Stir gently: After the edges start to set, use your spatula to gently stir the eggs in a slow, circular motion. You want to create soft folds, not aggressive stirring—this will give you those soft, fluffy curds that make scrambled eggs so delightful.

Cook to perfection: Continue stirring occasionally. The eggs will gradually firm up but still remain soft and creamy. When the eggs are just barely set and still a bit glossy (about 2-3 minutes), remove them from the pan immediately. They will continue to cook from the residual heat, and you want to avoid overcooking them.

Season and serve: Lightly season your scrambled eggs with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Feel free to top with a little fresh chives or a sprinkle of cheese if you like. Serve immediately while they’re warm and creamy!

A Few Tips:
Low and slow is the key to achieving that creamy, tender texture.
Don't be tempted to rush them! Cooking on too high a heat can make the eggs dry and rubbery.
Always remove the eggs from the pan just before they look completely done—they’ll keep cooking after you’ve taken them off the heat.
I hope you enjoy this method as much as I do. It’s a simple yet indulgent way to start the day right!

Happy cooking and enjoy your breakfast!

In tomorrow's society this is going to be extremely important because good jobs are going to be hard to come by. You need to set goals, study and work hard to get to where you want to get to and hopefully work doing something you love. Stay away from all drugs, never let anything get the best of you that's out of your control. Love is a powerful thing, if you want to be loved you have to love back. Create no enemies and if you do, be the first to forgive and forget. Things are certainly going to be tough but you got to be tougher. Be caring, supportive and kind and that will make for a happy life. Life isn't about money, life is about being happy. Everyone makes mistakes but instead of making the same mistake again, learn from the first one and make a better decision the second time around.

Hopefully you’ll find something you want to share your life with building a future. Getting married raising children getting a house. Being able to seeing your child or children grow up and teach them the same values you were taught. And if you are really lucking you’ll be able to grow old together enjoying every moment you can with each other. Hopefully things will be better also than they are now because everything is all about racism now. I grew up in an era where people treated everyone equally no matter what skin color they were. It’s so different now because that’s all they want to make things out to be. They are judging people by their skin color not the person. The other thing is the political parties are divided making it even worse for the country. You have men saying they are women and are being allowed to play in women’s sports. Illegal immigration’s running rampant in and the Democratic Party is letting them in.

I have an omelette sometimes at night, and I'll have eggs as part of a breakfast burrito, but I don't actually have eggs by themselves in the morning. So I'll give you a basic rundown of a popular technique. Crack the eggs into a pan. Heat it over the stove on a low setting. The idea is to let them really luxuriate in the flame, vicariously. Don't be afraid to flip them. I want to taste the food, not the heat source; don't let them burn or sear or get rubbery. When they're done you can slide them into a plate and add a little salt. Serve with bacon for real fun. Now bacon is something I know something about. Do it in the same pan as the eggs and let the grease seep into the egg. That is a decadent and tasty way to start your morning. Probably a little heavy in the protein for most diets, though. In reality I would only order this sort of thing at a restaurant or for brunch when they can really get it perfect. It requires an artist's touch.",6,6,5,2,3,2,1,1,3,1,1,6,6,4,5,Someone else,Yes

Hello! If you’re reading this in 2050, you’re now a wonderful 40-year-old adult, and I hope you’re thriving in a world that is even more amazing than today. As you think about the past and the people who came before you, I want you to remember me for a few things.

First and foremost, I hope to be remembered for kindness. I believe that small acts of kindness can create ripples that spread far beyond their origin. I want you to carry that spirit forward, helping others and spreading joy in your own way.

I also hope to have inspired curiosity and a love for learning. Knowledge is a powerful tool, and I want you to seek it out, ask questions, and never stop exploring the world around you. Whether it’s through stories, science, or art, let your imagination soar.

Additionally, I wish to be remembered for my passion for the environment. I hope I showed you the importance of taking care of our planet. Every effort counts, and I want you to continue that work, ensuring a healthy Earth for future generations.

Finally, I hope you remember my laughter and joy for life. Embrace every moment, celebrate your successes, and learn from your failures. Live fully and authentically.

Thank you for carrying my legacy into the future. I believe in you and the incredible impact you will have.

With all my love,  ",,6,7,5,5,3,2,1,1,5,2,1,7,5,5,6,Donald Trump,Yes

Wisdom NEVER should be confused with knowledge. There is no substitute for life experience, but to have true wisdom you have to have a relationship with God/Jesus. Stay independent in your thoughts and your actions. There will be many that will try to deceive you. People are NOT generally trustworthy. An example I can give you that I went through is getting through the propaganda of the Covid ""scamdemic/plandemic"" ... I paid attention to the PROPER people to get my information, and did not listen to mainstream news propaganda. I NEVER wore a virtue signaling slave mask, and certainly did not take the Big Pharma profit-death shots during covid. I changed many hearts and minds along the way with this, and saved lives as well. Freedom is NEVER free and sometimes we have to sacrifice to keep our freedoms and Liberties. In the end, I was right all along, as almost everything officials were telling us during the Plandemic was a lie. Now, the truth has come to light, and it is so unfortunate that, some very close friends and family who took the Big Pharma profit shot have died or have life long complications from these so called ""safe & effective"" mRNA - gene altering shots.

""Remember me for my fierce spirit, like a Chicago thunderstorm - powerful, wild, and free.

My heart raced with excitement for life's intense moments.
Stormy nights were my calm, thunder my lullaby.

With loved ones, I was gentle rain; nurturing growth.
With injustices, I was torrential downpour; unrelenting.

My passions:
- Wildlife roaming free
- Boxing's intense strategy
- Comedy's laughter and irony

Through videos, I shared my world.
In legacy, I hope stormy spirits find solace.

I lived life on my terms:
- Spontaneous road trips to nowhere
- Laughing till tears streamed down faces
- Speaking truth, even when harsh

My love for cats:
- Furry little thunderbolts in my life
- Comforting purrs during stormy nights

Impacts I hoped to leave:
- Inspired others to embrace wildness
- Supported animal shelters and conservation
- Made people laugh so hard they snorted

Traits that defined me:
- Fearless authenticity
- Quick wit and sarcasm
- Deep empathy for all living things

How I want to be remembered by:
- Friends: as loyal thunder beside them
- Family: as unwavering love and protection
- Strangers: as a fierce spirit who inspired freedom

Final words:
- 'Live wild, love fiercely, laugh endlessly'
- My story ends, but thunder remains.

This causes the eggs to be extremely easy to peel. Then you are ready to eat them in whatever recipe you were interested in preparing hard boiled eggs for. There are really no further instructions necessary for preparing, cooking and eating hard boiled eggs.  Although, it would help to use you favorite spices on the eggs after peeling.

You will then decide on your quantity with two being preferred.  You also need to decide if you want to melt butter, margarine or cook with olive oil.  Once those decisions are made choose a thick or cast iron skillet.
Melt the butter over medium heat and wait for it to melt completely.  Have a cover on hand for the skillet.  Once the butter is melted, introduce the eggs into the skillet. Big you chose to scramble, pour the mixture into the skillet; cover  it and leave it sit for 30 seconds.  At that point, turn the eggs and if necessary chop them into smaller pieces.

Still a lot of manual work on our farm (throwing hay bales all summer, and hand picking the outer rows of a corn field.  Rode a bicycle into town to the library to get books to read.

Enjoy life as you encounter it.  There will be plenty of the other aspects of life to put everything into perspective.  I almost died when my appendix ruptured, I had shoulder surgery to fix a torn rotator cuff, ulcerative colitis, major abdominal issues with my gall bladder being removed and then again almost dying before I got my liver transplant (it being delayed because of the “COVID pandemic” - look that one up!  circa 2019/2020).
I have had (and continue ti have) a great life!  You may be looking back and saying, “How archaic!”.  How did you survive?!

For most activities being in schoolyard was not big a deal as we played just about anything we could in schoolyard up the street where only a bunch of us that did not fit in schoolyard played. The one thing missing was basketball as back in the late 60 early 70 there were no portable baskets as there are now. So I went from a predominantly white elementary school and neighborhood to Junior High 6 blocks from my house but it seemed like a different world. Junior High introduced me to all kinds of races as kids as kids were coming via bus and subway. Particularly, I became good friends with many black kids as unlike the white kids from my neighborhood these kids invited me to play with them. High Schoo expanded my views of race as it was even more deversified.

Making eggs is easy.  Get a small to medium skillet and put a tablespoon of butter in the pan.  Put the pan on the range at a low temp to melt the butter.  

Crack two eggs into a bowl then use a fork to beat the eggs until they are well beaten.  Turn the skillet up to medium then add the eggs and a little salt.  Keep moving the eggs in the skillet until they are firm and not too wet.  

If you want, spread some shredded cheese on top for extra yummy eggs.

Put eggs on a plate and eat!

Hope you enjoy your breakfast and call me later to tell me how it turned out.

Eggs are versatile and easy to cook. Here are three common methods to prepare eggs for breakfast:

#### 1. **Scrambled Eggs**  
- Crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt, pepper, and a splash of milk or cream. Whisk well.  
- Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a small knob of butter.  
- Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Stir continuously with a spatula, scraping the bottom as the eggs cook.  
- Cook until soft and creamy. Remove from heat and serve immediately.  

#### 2. **Sunny-Side Up**  
- Heat a non-stick pan on low-medium heat and add a teaspoon of butter or oil.  
- Crack an egg directly into the pan, being careful not to break the yolk.  
- Cover the pan with a lid and let it cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolk remains runny.  
- Season with salt and pepper. Serve as is or on toast.  

#### 3. **Boiled Eggs**  
- Place eggs in a pot and cover with cold water.  
- Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, turn off the heat and cover the pot.  
   - Soft-boiled: 4-6 minutes  
   - Hard-boiled: 10-12 minutes  
- Transfer eggs to an ice bath to cool, then peel.  

Customize your eggs with toppings like herbs, cheese, or avocado. Pair them with toast, fruits, or veggies for a complete breakfast. Enjoy!",5,6,6,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,5,6,4,5,Donald Trump,Yes

Step 1. Make sure that they're eggs in the fridge, go ahead and take one or the appropriate amount if guests are over

2. Go over to your oven and start to slowly turn on the stove while making sure the pan you are about to use is clean to use to avoid health issues.

3. At the very edge of the pan make sure to crack the egg gently by softly tapping the egg against the edge of the pan in order to open the egg to allow to yolk to fall into the pan

4. Allow the egg to cook for a bit and make sure to watch over it as you can choose how you would like your eggs

5. Wait till the eggs are finished and then enjoy!

There are multiple ways to enjoy and make eggs, I just believe that this is the easiest way I personally make it and I hope you enjoy this method as well! Thank you for taking your time to read these instructions ",4,5,5,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,2,5,6,4,5,Kamala Harris,Yes
1048,32.6233,-97.0818,0,75,,Female,,"No, I do not have a college degree",No,,Black or African America,,,,,5,100000,,"Lets make soft scrambled eggs.  I would start by heating the griddle or frying pan/skillet with just a little oil, or butter or bacon grease, etc, just enough to not have eggs stuck to the pan.. After cracking the egg, I would beat it in a bowl and add my seasonings, i.e. salt and pepper, and occasionally I will add onions, jalapenos and/or sausage.  I know this sounds like ingredients for an omelet, which they are, but I also like scrambled eggs this way.  After scrambling the egg in the heated skillet or on the griddle, I will also toss in a little cheese on top.  Again, I know it sounds more like an omelet, but it is not fried but scrambled.  Depending on if you like your scrambled eggs soft or medium, it will be up to you to determine how long to scramble.  A soft scrambled egg will be fluffy and light as opposed to a medium scrambled.  If these steps are taken, you should end up with perfectly scrambled eggs,  If by chance you want an omelet, the same instructions will work, other than scrambling you would be lightly frying with the ingredients in the middle of the egg, then you would fold the egg while in the pan but just enough to slightly brown/fry while folded on both sides.",4,5,4,1,2,3,4,1,1,1,2,7,4,6,7,Kamala Harris,Yes

First you need to look into your refrigerator to see if you even have eggs to cook. Then you take them out and let them warm up a little bit. Get your pan sizzling hot I usually have mine around 350 degrees to cook eggs. Once your pain is hot put some thin layer of oil in the bottom of the pan. Let the oil heat up. Then you want to crack your eggs and put your eggs into the pan. Then let the eggs cook for about a minute on one side. Then you want to flip them over to the other side and let them cook for between 1 minute and a minute and a half. Then if you want them over easy you take them out and they're done. Or if you want them to be over medium or over hard you let them cook for about 2 minutes longer for over medium. If you want them to be over hard when you put them in the pan from the raw State take your spatula and crack the middle of the egg so it flows across the rest of the egg before you flip it. That's how you cook the perfect egg my way.,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,7,7,7,1,Donald Trump,Yes

Crack the eggs into the bowl and throw away the shell.  Use the fork to beat the eggs so you can no longer see the individual eggs.  While you are beating the eggs, take a pat of butter and put in the pan.  Turn your fire to medium to melt the butter.  Once the butter is melted and you have beaten the eggs, pour the egg mixture into the pan.  It should sizzle.  Sprinkle salt and pepper.  Then use a spatula to scrape the eggs and scramble them.  This should take less than a minute.  Before they turn brown, continue to move the eggs in the skillet.  When they are  no longer runny, scrape the eggs into a plate.

I think as I was younger I was always trying to be something I wasn’t and fake and just disconnected from who I really was.  I learned as I got older the most blessings I get from people are the black sheep and the misfits and the people who struggle and have faith everything will work out for a reason and some of the most generous people were not even people who had money but had the heart to give literally every last cent they had to help someone.  I never learned what that was like growing up so to see that in others made me want to be that kind of person but it’s hard.  ,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,5,5,4,4,1,1,I did not vote,Yes

You'll need 1 egg, butter or margarine (or oil can be used). 

Whisk one egg with seasoning to your liking. Butter a pan until the butter is sizzling. 

Pour the egg over the sizzling butter and begin to dry the egg. You can use a fork or your whisk to continue to cook the egg, but it's better to finish with a fork. 

Different tastes will call for different cook times. For example, some people like runny eggs while others like their eggs fried hard. 

The longer the egg is friend the harder the egg will be.

Once the egg is off the heat and on your plate, you can season it again if you like.

Viola! You have an egg...... Enjoy....",3,5,4,3,4,3,2,2,2,3,1,6,6,6,6,Donald Trump,Yes

I hope this letter finds you living happy and healthy. I have lived a life that hopefully honored God and left the world a better place.  I hope that you have found Jesus and have a fulfilling relationship with him.  It's through Jesus and his word (the Bible) that I lived my life.  I respected others through my words and actions.  I hope you do this as well.  I served others at church and around my community.  Hopefully the world is in a place that you find these opportunities.  I have supported many charities. I hope the world doesn't need this as much as they do today but that if an opportunity arises that you are able to step up and help out.  God teaches us to take care of the widows, orphans and those less fortunate than ourselves.  In following God's will for us he then takes care of us.  The world will be a better place if we all thought of others before ourselves.  No matter what you are doing in life, whatever or wherever your passions are, please remember to be nice to others and yourself.  This will make the world better.  As I write this letter, that is my ambition, to take care of you, others and myself.  Again, hopefully you know Jesus and we can meet in heaven once you've lived a full and lengthy life.

Take care!",,4,1,4,5,1,1,1,1,5,5,3,7,7,7,4,Donald Trump,Yes

One popular method is scrambling. To make scrambled eggs, start by cracking 2-3 eggs into a bowl and whisking them together. Add a pinch of salt and pepper for flavor. In a non-stick skillet, heat a small amount of butter or oil over medium heat. Once hot, pour the eggs into the skillet and gently stir with a spatula, allowing them to cook evenly. Continue stirring occasionally until the eggs are soft and creamy, then remove from heat and serve immediately. If you prefer a firmer texture, you can cook them a bit longer, but be careful not to overcook. For sunny-side-up eggs, heat a small amount of oil or butter in a skillet over low to medium heat. Crack an egg into the skillet, taking care not to break the yolk. Cook the egg until the white is set, but the yolk remains runny—this usually takes about 2-3 minutes. For over-easy eggs, flip the egg gently once the white is set, and cook for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute, ensuring the yolk remains slightly runny. Boiled eggs are another classic, where you place eggs in a pot of cold water, bring it to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer for 9-12 minutes, depending on how firm you want the yolk. Once done, remove the eggs from the hot water and cool them in an ice bath before peeling. With these basic techniques, you can enjoy eggs in many delicious ways.",5,6,6,4,4,3,4,2,2,3,3,5,5,6,4,Donald Trump,Yes

Cooking makes some nutrients more digestible
Cooking eggs makes them safer to eat, and it also makes some of their nutrients easier to digest.

One example of this is the protein in eggs.

Studies have shown it becomes more digestible when it’s heated (3Trusted Source).

In fact, one study found that the human body could use 91% of the protein in cooked eggs, compared to only 51% in raw eggs (4Trusted Source).

This change in digestibility is thought to occur because heat causes structural changes in the egg proteins.

In raw eggs, the large protein compounds are separate from each other and curled up in complex, twisted structures.

When the proteins are cooked, heat breaks the weak bonds that hold them in shape.

The proteins then form new bonds with other proteins around them. These new bonds in the cooked egg are easier for your body to digest.

You can see these changes occurring as the egg white and yolk change from a thick gel to rubbery and firm.

The protein in raw eggs can also interfere with the availability of the micronutrient biotin.

Eggs are a good source of biotin, which is an important nutrient used in fat and sugar metabolism.

1. Choose a low-calorie cooking method
If you’re trying to cut back on calories, choose poached or boiled eggs.

These cooking methods don’t add any extra fat calories, so the meal will be lower in calories than fried or scrambled eggs or an omelet.

2. Combine them with vegetables
Eggs go really well with vegetables.

This means that eating eggs is a great opportunity to boost your vegetable intake and add extra fiber and vitamins to your meal.

Some simple ideas include adding the vegetables of your choice into an omelet or scrambled eggs, like in this recipe.

Or simply cook the eggs whichever way you want and have vegetables on the side.

3. Fry them in an oil that’s stable at high temperatures
The best oils for cooking at high heat, like when pan-frying, are those that remain stable at high temperatures and don’t oxidize easily to form harmful free radicals.

Examples of good choices include avocado oil and sunflower oil. If using extra-virgin olive oil or coconut oil, it’s best to cook at temperatures lower than 410°F (210°C) and 350°F (177°C), respectively.

4. Choose the most nutritious eggs you can afford
A number of factors, including the farming method and chicken’s diet, can influence the nutritional quality of eggs (25Trusted Source).

In general, pasture-raised and organic eggs are thought to be nutritionally superior to caged and conventionally produced eggs.

This article goes into detail about the nutritional differences between eggs produced by different methods.

5. Don’t overcook them
The longer and hotter you cook your eggs, the more nutrients you may lose.

Using higher heat for longer may also increase the amount of oxidized cholesterol they contain, which is particularly true of pan-frying.

SUMMARY
To make your eggs as healthy as possible, choose a low-calorie cooking method, combine them with vegetables, fry them in a heat-stable oil, and don’t overcook them.

The bottom line
Overall, shorter and lower-heat cooking methods cause less cholesterol oxidation and help retain most of the egg’s nutrients.

For this reason, poached and boiled (either hard or soft) eggs may be the healthiest to eat. These cooking methods also don’t add any unnecessary calories.

All that being said, eating eggs is generally super healthy, no matter which way you cook them.

So you may just want to cook and eat them in the way you enjoy the most and not obsess over the small details.

While I expected that I would be able to teach students at all learning levels, I quickly learned that teaching goes far beyond curriculum content.  It also means having a positive impact on young people who, in many cases, need someone to care about them and believe in them.  When students know you care about them, it opens their minds far more more and encourages them to want to know all that you have to teach, both the content of the course and life lessons.  Whether a person becomes an educator at a private or public school or simply work for a company, the opportunity to educate and support and encourage others to help them reach their goal makes what you do for them so much more significant.

First and most simply you can boil them. Put your egg or eggs in a pot of water, bring water to boil and leave them to cook 8 minutes. Place egg under cold water until it's at a temperature comfortable enough to touch. Remove egg from pot, then peel the shell. You can now eat your egg. Typically eggs are served with salt and pepper depending on flavor needs.

Next, you can fry your egg in which you crack the egg into a pan with a teaspoon of hot oil and let it cook. You can flip the egg to get a brown coat over it's entirely, or cook the side which it was cracked and that way is called ""suny side up"". Again, it's common to serve with salt and pepper depending on your taste and flavor need.

Another common way to cook eggs is scrambled. To scramble your breakfast eggs crack into a bowl, make sure no shell gets into the egg, then whip egg using an eggbeater or fork until entirely whillped. Then cook in a pan of hot oil by pouring your scrambled egg and turning it constantly until browned. Then remove cooked egg from pan and serve. Many like to eat scrambled eggs with salsa or cheese over them, or along with toast.

You can also use the scrambled egg to make an omelette in which you pour egg into the pan and let it cook while adding your favorite toppings. Common additions are ham, bacon, peppers, mushrooms and onions. Another common omelette style has avocado , sour cream and salsa added to your meat of choice.",4,3,4,3,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,4,4,2,6,Donald Trump,Yes

1542,31.1823,-83.7641,0,70,,Female,,"No, I do not have a college degree",No,White,,,,,,6,40000,,"My favorite way to cook eggs is by combining eggs with many other ingredients and booking them in a baking dish, 9 x 11 or so.  I use the disposable aluminum kind.  Some of the ingredients are broccoli, onion, red and green pepper, cheese, half and half milk, bacon or ham or some kind of meat.  Bake on 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes until it is set.  I have made several batches at once, cut them up in squares and put them in the freezer in individual servings, so that they can be thawed overnight in the fridge and then microwaved the next morning.  I also use spinach as an ingredient in the casserole.  For the veggies and those type ingredients I have used my food processor to chop them into small pieces so they will cook enough.  The eggs are whipped with the milk so that it is a creamery version.  There are as many possibilities of ingredients as you desire and like.  The basic ingredients are eggs, milk(half and half), and cheese.  It provides the protein your body needs as part of your daily amount required.  You can also put this mixture in muffin tins and have them as egg bites, or as snacks or as something that can be used at a gathering as a snack.  You can also make egg bites like omelets in layers in muffin tins with the same type ingredients.  Either way are favorites of mine.  Eggs are very versatile food products that provide protein for you.  I can think of no other way that you can make eggs that everyone enjoys and likes more than this method.  This is a very basic method of cooking eggs, and I can think of nothing else to say about it.",2,4,3,4,1,2,2,1,2,4,3,6,6,6,4,Donald Trump,Yes

At the end of the day, it is quite true that we take nothing from this life beyond the experiences lived and beyond the achievements that we carry in our hearts and the experiences that we are able to remember.
